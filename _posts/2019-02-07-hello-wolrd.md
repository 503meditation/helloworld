Welcome to the gurumeditation.zone ãƒ„

This site aims to form a centralised information resource for those seeking a deeper connection to the hybrid-media forms as developed and explored by artists of the Guru Meditation record label.

Taking a more direct (and format agnostic) approach to more traditional knowledge sharing practices of the modern age, this web portal is formed in hope of offering a more holistic view into this new sound-world.

A core belief and founding principle of Guru Meditation is the promotion of accessible and open source technologies for creators / consumers, side-stepping traditional didactic corporate platforms. By publishing content directly to the .zone, we can communicate and on a more honest level, away from the destructive grips of data harvesters masquerading as technical philanthropists.

This site was built (for free) with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and is hosted (for free) on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>. The entire codebase can be viewed by anyone directly from our public <a href="https://github.com/503meditation/helloworld">503meditation repo</a>
