beyond the Guru Meditation sound-world, the .zone was built with the intention of collating art from across mediums and scenes to find a through-line between seemingly disparate areas of creative exploration. this post acts as the first in a series of looser posts shining some light on something that we recommend for the attention of .zone explorers ❦

let the data sharing commence..

## Machine Music

Draw some focus to *System Beeps* by <a href="https://shiru.untergrund.net/">shiru8bit</a>, an album written on and for a motherboard speaker manipulated via MS-DOS program.

Much of this achievement speaks for itself; a challenging format defined by its limitations, the monophonic motherboard speaker was only ever used to produce error tone feedback so this project absolutely pushes the limit of the original hardware. Coupled with a gorgeous GUI there is certainly no other musician exploring these avenues in the modern day.

Much-like classic repurposed and tweaked hardware stories of the roland tb 303 (maxed out to create acid house) this MS-DOS program takes a similar logic, which Shiru refers to as the `retrocomputing demoscene formula`, and applies it to the motherboard speaker. Truly commendable efforts.

Shiru also explores the parodixically named idea of `Monophonic Polyphony` in which various techniques are employed to mask the fact that only one sound channel (or voice) of a singular pitch can be triggered at a time. This can be heard throughout the project and is deployed to exquisite effect on tracks like 'Head Step'. See also the emulation of rhythm tracks using similar techniques on 'Astro Force'.

The whole project (the music itself, player source code, and Reaper projects) is available with an open CC-BY license allowing others to distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon the work, even commercially, as long as they credit the original creation.

If all this sounds interesting i mucho recommendo checking out shiru's full post with more detail outlining the build process over at <a href="https://habr.com/en/post/439192/">PC Speaker To Eleven</a> and find the whole thing to download on bandcamp <a href="https://shiru8bit.bandcamp.com/album/system-beeps">here</a>.
